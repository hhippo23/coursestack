# coursestack
Coursestack is a curriculum package for secondary schools. It allows teachers to write, comment and link lessons to curriculum frameworks. It facilitates course auditing and evaluation and makes teacher compliance reports a breeze.
Coursestack is a trial project which aims to show modern technologies can be used to make teaching and course evaluation much more efficient and less time consuming. The idea is lessons are developed inside the package and can be re used. There is an inbuilt calendar to keep track of lesson sequence. The novel feature of coursestack is reports. Courses, sections of reports can be compared to one or more frameworks for compliance and the activities used to teach course concepts can be evaluated. Coursestack ultimately will allow a teacher to develop assessment plans and tasks based on what has been taught in a course as opposed to a framework and map students results to activities and assess the effectiveness of framework implmentation. This feature has not yet been added to the class library.
Coursestack is under development and many features while working still need improvement. People who are interested in this project should keep an eye on this readme as updates will be added as new features are added. 
Thanks HHippo
